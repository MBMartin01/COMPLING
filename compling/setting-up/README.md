# Setting up your computer for the course

There are four key things to establish. Each 
is handled in its own markdown file. Some of this 
material is repeated in other repositories for the course, but 
I have chosen to compile everything here to serve as a reference 
for you. 

- [ ] Basics of using the command line ([CommandLine.md](CommandLine.md))
- [ ] Install python and creating environment ([Python.md](Python.md))
- [ ] Github and Github Classroom ([Github.md](Github.md))
- [ ] Google Colab ([Colab.md](Colab.md))

Proceeding in the above order is preferable (you'll link your Github to 
GoogleDrive in setting up colab). Where applicable, I will mention 
operating system differences. I've personally tried these installs 
on Ubuntu (Linux) and Windows 10, as well as an old mac. The new Mac's 
have certain challenges (with huggingface/pytorch in particular), 
and I still need to workshop those. If you are having problems, 
please let me know. If you just can't get things to work on 
your machine, or you'd rather not install things, the colab
option should work for everyone (as long as you have reliable 
wifi). 

Below I touch briefly on text editors, which you may find helpful if you 
do the assignments on your computer. 

## Text Editors

For editing programs, I use [vim](https://www.vim.org/). I know people have strong feelings about vim. Other, perhaps more friendly, alternatives include [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and [Eclipse](https://www.pydev.org/). You could also just use the plain text editor on your computer, as we won't be building huge code bases in the course. If you do try vim, I'd be happy to share with 
you my vimrc which has alright settings. Additionally, I can show you how to add some nice
plugins.
